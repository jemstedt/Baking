# Planning my next bread

## Day 1: Feeding sourdough starter
### Feeding the starter during the evening day 1
Add 70 g of water and 70 g of flour to the starter. Let it rest over night in room temperature.

## Day 2: Mixing, fermenting and shaping
### Mixing the ingredients
- 300 g bread flour (Vetemjöl special)
- 200 g full grain bread flour (vetemjöl special fullkorn)
- 350 g water
- 120 g sourdough starter
- 10 g salt

Bulk ferment
Approximatly 4 hours. After ca 1 hour i did 3 stretch and folds with ca 1 hour in between each set. Room temperature ca. 23 °C (73°F)

### Shaping
Maybe dont pre-shape since you're only making one bread. Pour the dough directly onto a floured work space. Then shape it and put it in the floured banneton. Fold the two sides onto itself and then roll then dough into its final shape.

### Proofing
Proof in room temp in the banneton for approximatly 6 hours. Poke it to see when it's ready. The dough should rise slowely after the poke, not fast. 

## Day 3:

### Oven temperature 

230&deg;C (445&deg;F) with heat from bottom and top, not using the fan. I heard somewhere that the fan can remove steam, but maybe that is not a problem when you use a dutch oven.

### Scoring the bread
Score the bread with a razor.

### Steam
Spray the dough with water before putting the lid over the dough.
