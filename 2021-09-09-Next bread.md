## Day 1: Feeding sourdough starter
### Feeding the starter during the evening day 1
Add 70 g of water and 70 g of flour to the starter. Let it rest over night in room temperature.

## Day 2: Mixing, fermenting and shaping
### Mixing the ingredients
- 300 g bread flour (Vetemjöl special)
- 200 g full grain bread flour (vetemjöl special fullkorn)
- 350 g water
- 120 g sourdough starter
- 10 g salt

### Shaping
Maybe dont pre-shape since you're only making one bread. Pour the dough directly onto a floured work space. Then shape it and put it in the floured banneton. Fold the two sides onto itself and then roll then dough into its final shape.

### Proofing
Proof in room temp in the banneton and then into the fridge over night. The time in room temperature may vary. Poke it to see when it's ready. The dough should rise slowely after the poke, not fast. 

## Day 3:

### Oven temperature 

230&deg;C (445&deg;F) with heat from bottom and top, not using the fan. I heard somewhere that the fan can remove steam, but maybe that is not a problem when you use a dutch oven.

### Scoring the bread
Score the bread with a razor.

### Steam
Spray the dough with water before putting the lid over the dough.
