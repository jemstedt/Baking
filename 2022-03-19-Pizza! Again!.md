## Day 1: Feeding sourdough starter
### Feeding the starter during the evening day 1
Add 70 g of water and 70 g of flour to the starter. Let it rest over night in room temperature.

## Day 2: Mixing, fermenting and shaping
### Mixing the ingredients
(4 pizzas)
- 600 g bread flour (Vetemj√∂l special)
- 360 g water (63% hydration)
- 120 g sourdough starter
- 15 g salt

### Shaping
Divide the dough into 4 parts in shape it into buns. You dont need to work the dough here to shape it or give it surface. 

### Bulk ferment
Leave in room temperature for ca 4 hours if you have the same temperature that I did, that is, 22-23 &deg;C (they used 3 hours but in 27 &deg;C in the original recepie).

### Proofing
Proofed in fridge until you need to use it. Good for at least a week (according to original recipe).

### Oven temperature 
Fan and top grill. Maximum degrees (250 &deg;C in video). Preheat for 45 minutes.

### Final shaping
Flour the dough with lots of flour. Make a dent and then stretch it to the size you want.

### Cooking
Cook for about 8-10 minutes until ready

### Result
Really good. However, use less sauce and mozzarella next time. The pizzas got wet.
