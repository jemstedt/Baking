# 80% hydration

## Day 1: Feeding sourdough starter
### Feeding the starter during the evening on day 1
Add 60 g of water and 60 g of flour to the starter. Let it rest all day at room temperature.

## Day 2: Do the rest
### Mixing the ingredients
- 300 g bread flour (Vetemjöl special)
- 200 g full grain bread flour (vetemjöl special fullkorn)
- 390 g water 
- ca 100 g sourdough starter
- 10 g salt

### Bulk ferment
Approximately 5 hours (normally 8:00 to 13:00). After 1 hour, I did 3 stretches and folds with 1 hour in between each set.

### Shaping
I pour the dough directly onto a floured workspace, shape it, and put it in a floured banneton. Thereafter, I fold the two sides onto themselves and then roll the dough into its final shape.

### Proofing
Approximately 6.5 hours. Proofed in fridge from 13:00 to 19:30.

### Scoring the bread
A straight, simple cut

### Steam
No extra spraying of water or anything like that. It worked out great.

### Oven temperature 

Heat the oven to 250&deg;C (482&deg;F) with heat from bottom and top, not using the fan. I heat tha dutch oven at the same time as the oven. I then lowered the temp to 230&deg;C The bread first cooked with the dutch oven for 20 minutes and then lowed the temperature to 200&deg;C and baked the bread for another 20 minutes. 230deg;C through the whole bake.

### Result
Yet unknown!
