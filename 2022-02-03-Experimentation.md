## Day 1: Feeding sourdough starter
### Feeding the starter during the evening day 1
Add 70 g of water and 70 g of flour to the starter. Let it rest all day in room temperature.

## Day 2: Do the rest
### Mixing the ingredients
- 250 g bread flour (Vetemjöl special)
- 150 g full grain bread flour (vetemjöl special fullkorn)
- 100 g spelt (dinkel)
- 360 g water 
- ca 130 g sourdough starter
- 10 g salt

### Bulk ferment
Approximatly 4 hours (ca 8:30 to 12:30). After ca 1 hour i did 3 stretch and folds with ca 30 minutes in between each set.
Room temperature ca. 21&deg;C (69&deg;F) for the first hour, then in the bathroom 25&deg;C (77&deg;F)

Poured the dough directly onto a floured work space and then shaped it and put it in the floured banneton. Folded the two sides onto itself and then roll then dough into its final shape.

No extra spraying of water or anything like that. It worked out great

### Oven temperature 

Heated the oven to 250&deg;C (482&deg;F) with heat from bottom and top, not using the fan. I heated tha dutch oven at the same time as the oven. I then lowered the temp to 230&deg;C The bread first cooked with the dutch oven for 20 minutes and then lowed the temperature to 200&deg;C and baked the bread for another 20 minutes. 230deg;C through the whole bake.

Great! All I could wish for.
