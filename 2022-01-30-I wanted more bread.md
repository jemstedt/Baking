# I wanted more bread

## Day 1: Feeding sourdough starter
### Feeding the starter during the evening day 1

## Day 2: Do the rest
### Mixing the ingredients

- 150 g full grain bread flour (vetemjöl special fullkorn)
- 100 g spelt (dinkel)
- 360 g water 
- ca 130 g sourdough starter
- 10 g salt

### Bulk ferment
Approximatly 4 hours (ca 8:00 to 12:00). After ca 1 hour i did 3 stretch and folds with ca 30 minutes in between each set.
Room temperature ca. 21&deg;C (69&deg;F) for the first hour, then in the bathroom 25&deg;C (77&deg;F)

### Oven temperature 

Heated the oven to 250&deg;C (482&deg;F) with heat from bottom and top, not using the fan. I heated tha dutch oven at the same time as the oven. I then lowered the temp to 230&deg;C The bread first cooked with the dutch oven for 20 minutes and then lowed the temperature to 200&deg;C and baked the bread for another 20 minutes. 230deg;C through the whole bake.
